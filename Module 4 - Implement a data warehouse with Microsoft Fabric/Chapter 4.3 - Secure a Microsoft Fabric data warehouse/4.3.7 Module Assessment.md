Here are the correct answers to your questions:

1. **What is the primary advantage of Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)?**  
   ✅ *It limits data exposure by obscuring sensitive information in real time.*  
   - Dynamic Data Masking doesn't change the actual data in the database, it only masks the output for unauthorized users.  
   - It requires minimal coding to implement (just column definitions or simple policies).

2. **What is the purpose of a security predicate function in Row-Level Security (RLS)?**  
   ✅ *It determines whether a row is accessible to a user based on certain conditions.*  
   - The function evaluates to TRUE/FALSE for each row, controlling visibility.  
   - While type conversions can happen in predicates, they're not the purpose.  
   - RLS doesn't inherently enable ad hoc queries.

3. **What happens when a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission?**  
   ✅ *The DENY always supersedes the GRANT, and the user is denied access to the specific object.*  
   - In Microsoft's permission model, DENY takes precedence over GRANT as a security safeguard.  
   - There's no "conflict" - DENY explicitly blocks access regardless of previous GRANTs.

All three correct answers reflect fundamental security principles in modern data platforms: real-time protection (DDM), conditional access control (RLS), and explicit denial taking precedence in permission hierarchies.
