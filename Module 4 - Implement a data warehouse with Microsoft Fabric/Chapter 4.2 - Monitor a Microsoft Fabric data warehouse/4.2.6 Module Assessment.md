Here are the correct answers to your knowledge check questions:

1. **You want to monitor capacity unit consumption in your Fabric data warehouse. What tools should you use?**
   - ✅ **Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app**  
   (This is the primary tool for monitoring capacity unit (CU) consumption in Microsoft Fabric)

2. **Which dynamic management view provides details about SQL commands running in the data warehouse?**
   - ✅ **sys.dm_exec_requests**  
   (This DMV provides information about currently executing requests/commands in the data warehouse)

3. **Which view should you use to identify commonly run commands in your data warehouse?**
   - ✅ **queryinsights.frequently_run_queries**  
   (This view specifically identifies queries that are run frequently in your data warehouse)

The other options are incorrect because:
- For question 1: While Azure Monitor can monitor many Azure resources, the Fabric Capacity Metrics app is specifically designed for monitoring Fabric capacity units.
- For question 2: dm_exec_connections shows connection info and dm_exec_sessions shows session info, but not the specific commands being run.
- For question 3: exec_requests_history shows historical requests and long_running_queries shows slow queries, but not necessarily frequently run ones.
