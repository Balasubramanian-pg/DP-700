## Detailed Explanation of Correct Answers

#### 1. Monitoring Capacity Unit Consumption

**✅ Correct Answer: Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app**

*   **Why it's correct:** The Capacity Metrics app is the dedicated, built-in tool within the Fabric admin portal designed specifically for this purpose. It provides a holistic view of how your purchased Capacity Units (CUs) are being consumed across all Fabric workloads (Data Engineering, Data Warehousing, Power BI, etc.).
*   **What it shows:** You can see real-time and historical CU usage, break down consumption by specific item (e.g., a warehouse), and identify peak activity periods. This is essential for cost management and capacity planning.
*   **Why the other option is incorrect:** While *Azure Monitor* is a powerful general-purpose monitoring service for Azure, it is not the primary or most direct tool for tracking Fabric's internal CU metric, which is unique to the Fabric platform.

#### 2. Identifying Currently Running SQL Commands

**✅ Correct Answer: sys.dm_exec_requests**

*   **Why it's correct:** This Dynamic Management View (DMV) is the go-to source for seeing what is happening *right now*. It returns a row for every currently executing request or command within the database, including the SQL text (`command`), the user who started it (`session_id`), its status, and resource usage metrics like CPU time and reads.
*   **Practical Use:** A database administrator would query this DMV to troubleshoot a performance issue, identify a long-running query that is blocking others, or simply monitor current activity.
*   **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    *   **`sys.dm_exec_connections`** provides information about connections established to the database engine (e.g., login time, client version) but not the specific commands being run over those connections.
    *   **`sys.dm_exec_sessions`** provides information about active user sessions (e.g., login name, login time, client program name) but is more about the "who" and "how" of the connection, not the "what" of the command being executed.

#### 3. Identifying Frequently Run Commands

**✅ Correct Answer: queryinsights.frequently_run_queries**

*   **Why it's correct:** This view is part of the **Query Insights** schema, which is specifically designed for analyzing query performance and patterns. As the name clearly states, `frequently_run_queries` is curated to automatically identify and surface queries that are executed most often.
*   **Why it's valuable:** Identifying frequent queries is crucial for performance tuning. Optimizing a query that runs thousands of times a day (even if each run is fast) will have a much greater overall impact on system performance than optimizing a slow query that only runs once a week.
*   **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    *   **`queryinsights.exec_requests_history`** provides a general history of executed queries but is not specifically optimized or filtered to highlight the *most frequent* ones.
    *   **`queryinsights.long_running_queries`** is designed to highlight queries with high execution times, which is a different performance characteristic than frequency. A query can be run frequently but be fast, or run rarely but be very slow.

### Summary

Your answers are spot on. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the monitoring tools in Microsoft Fabric:

*   Use the **Capacity Metrics App** for the high-level **"Cost"** perspective.
*   Use **Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)** like `sys.dm_exec_requests` for a deep, technical **"Diagnostics"** perspective on current activity.
*   Use **Query Insights** views like `frequently_run_queries` for a user-friendly **"Performance Patterns"** perspective.

Well done!
