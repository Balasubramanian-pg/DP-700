### **1. When designing an ETL process for a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse, which tool can be used to visually represent transformations without traditional programming?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Dataflows Gen2**  
*(Dataflows Gen2 provides a low-code/no-code interface for designing ETL transformations visually, similar to Power Query.)*  

---
### **2. During an ETL process, which step is crucial after ingesting data into a lakehouse to ensure data quality and consistency?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Data transformation**  
*(After ingestion, data must be cleaned, validated, and transformed to ensure quality and consistency before analysis.)*  

---
### **3. How does a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse differ from a typical data lake in terms of data processing capabilities?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Lakehouses integrate SQL and Spark engines for advanced data processing.**  
*(Lakehouses combine the scalability of data lakes with the performance and ACID transactions of data warehouses, supporting both SQL and Spark analytics.)*  

---
### **4. Which Microsoft Fabric component allows you to integrate external data into your lakehouse while keeping it stored in its original location?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Shortcuts**  
*(Shortcuts in OneLake allow referencing external data without duplicating it, enabling a unified view across storage systems.)*  

---
### **5. What is a significant benefit of schema-on-read in Microsoft Fabric lakehouses compared to predefined schemas in traditional data warehouses?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Schema-on-read allows for more flexible data ingestion and transformation.**  
*(Unlike rigid schema-on-write in traditional warehouses, schema-on-read enables storing raw data and applying structure only when needed, improving flexibility.)*  

---
### **6. Which feature of Microsoft Fabric lakehouses supports machine learning and predictive modeling analytics?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Spark and SQL engines**  
*(Apache Spark in Fabric lakehouses enables distributed processing for ML, while SQL engines support analytical queries.)*  

---
### **7. Your organization wants to combine structured transaction data with social media feeds for analysis. Why might a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse be more suitable than a traditional data warehouse?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Lakehouses can store all data formats and support SQL-based analytics.**  
*(Lakehouses handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., JSON, text) while still enabling SQL queries, unlike traditional warehouses that require rigid schemas.)*  

---
### **8. Which component in Microsoft Fabric lakehouse architecture is responsible for orchestrating ETL processes?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Data Factory pipelines**  
*(Data Factory provides orchestration capabilities to schedule and manage complex ETL workflows.)*  

---
### **9. Your organization plans to train machine learning models using data from a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse. Which tool is most appropriate for performing this task?**  

✅ **Answer:** **Notebooks**  
*(Notebooks (e.g., Spark notebooks in Fabric) are ideal for ML model development, offering Python/R support and interactive data exploration.)*
