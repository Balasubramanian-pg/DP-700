## **Check Your Knowledge: Medallion Architecture in Fabric**

Test your understanding of the core concepts, tools, and best practices for implementing a medallion architecture in a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse.


#### **1. Which of the following sets of layers are typically associated with the Medallion Architecture for data management?**

<div align="center">
<svg width="300" height="80" viewBox="0 0 300 80" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<circle cx="50" cy="40" r="25" fill="#FFF3E0" stroke="#E65100" stroke-width="3"/>
<text x="50" y="45" font-family="Segoe UI, sans-serif" font-size="10" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Bronze</text>

<text x="150" y="45" font-family="Segoe UI, sans-serif" font-size="10" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Silver</text>
<circle cx="250" cy="40" r="25" fill="#FFFDE7" stroke="#F57F17" stroke-width="3"/>
<text x="250" y="45" font-family="Segoe UI, sans-serif" font-size="10" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Gold</text>
</svg>
</div>

*   A. Raw, Polished, Refined
*   **B. Bronze, Silver, Gold**
*   C. Initial, Intermediate, Final

> [!TIP]
> **Correct Answer: B. Bronze, Silver, Gold**
>
> **Explanation:** The medallion architecture uses a standardized three-tier approach with specific naming conventions that signify increasing data quality and value:
> *   **Bronze Layer**: Contains raw, unprocessed data ingested directly from source systems. It's the landing zone.
> *   **Silver Layer**: Contains cleansed, validated, and conformed data. Business logic and enrichment have been applied.
> *   **Gold Layer**: Contains highly curated, business-ready data, often aggregated and optimized for analytics and reporting.
>
> This terminology, originating from Databricks, has become the industry standard for structuring a lakehouse. The other options describe similar concepts but are not the standard medallion architecture terms.

#### **2. Which tool is best suited for data transformation in Fabric when dealing with large-scale data that will continue to grow?**

<div align="center">
<svg width="100" height="80" viewBox="0 0 100 80" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<rect x="25" y="20" width="50" height="40" rx="4" fill="#FBE9E7" stroke="#D84315" stroke-width="2"/>
<path d="M35 32 L 45 40 L 35 48" stroke="#BF360C" stroke-width="2.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
<path d="M50 50 H 70" stroke="#BF360C" stroke-width="2.5" stroke-linecap="round"/>
</svg>
</div>

*   A. Dataflows (Gen2)
*   B. Pipelines
*   **C. Notebooks**

> [!TIP]
> **Correct Answer: C. Notebooks**
>
> **Explanation:** For large-scale data that requires scalability, **Notebooks** are the definitive choice. They provide direct access to the distributed computing power of Apache Spark.
>
> **Why Notebooks Excel at Scale:**
> *   **Apache Spark Integration:** Natively leverage Spark's engine for processing petabyte-scale datasets through horizontal scaling.
> *   **Flexibility & Power:** Support for Python, SQL, Scala, and R allows for complex transformations, custom logic, and machine learning model integration that visual tools can't match.
> *   **Performance Optimization:** Give developers fine-grained control over partitioning, caching, and other Spark optimizations to ensure efficient processing.
>
> **Why Not the Other Options?**
> *   **Dataflows (Gen2):** Excellent for visual, low-code ETL but are better suited for small-to-medium scale scenarios and have limited scalability compared to Spark notebooks.
> *   **Pipelines:** These are orchestrators, not transformation engines. A pipeline *calls* other tools (like notebooks or dataflows) to perform the actual work.
>
> ```python
> # Example: Large-scale transformation in a Notebook
> # This code can efficiently process billions of records on a Spark cluster.
> large_dataset = spark.read.table("bronze_transactions")
> 
> transformed_data = (large_dataset
>     .filter(col("amount") > 0)
>     .withColumn("processed_date", current_date())
>     .groupBy("customer_id", "product_category")
>     .agg(sum("amount").alias("total_spent"))
> )
> 
> transformed_data.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("silver_customer_spending")
> ```

#### **3. What is the benefit of storing different layers of your lakehouse in separate workspaces?**

<div align="center">
<svg width="200" height="80" viewBox="0 0 200 80" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<rect x="10" y="20" width="50" height="40" rx="5" fill="#FFF3E0" stroke="#E65100" stroke-width="2"/>
<rect x="75" y="20" width="50" height="40" rx="5" fill="#F5F5F5" stroke="#616161" stroke-width="2"/>
<rect x="140" y="20" width="50" height="40" rx="5" fill="#FFFDE7" stroke="#F57F17" stroke-width="2"/>
<path d="M35 15 L 35 5" stroke="#424242" stroke-width="1.5"/><path d="M100 15 L 100 5" stroke="#424242" stroke-width="1.5"/><path d="M165 15 L 165 5" stroke="#424242" stroke-width="1.5"/>

</div>

*   **A. It can enhance security, manage capacity use, and optimize cost-effectiveness.**
*   B. It makes it easier to share data with colleagues.
*   C. There's no benefit of storing different layers of your lakehouse in separate workspaces.

> [!SUCCESS]
> **Correct Answer: A. It can enhance security, manage capacity use, and optimize cost-effectiveness.**
>
> **Explanation:** Storing medallion layers in separate workspaces is a strategic architectural decision that provides significant advantages in security, governance, and operational management.
>
> #### **Enhanced Security**
> It allows you to create clear security boundaries, granting access only where needed.
>
> | Workspace | Typical Access | Key Restriction |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | **Bronze Workspace** | Data Engineers, Platform Team | No business user access. |
> | **Silver Workspace** | Data Engineers, Analysts, Scientists | No direct access to raw data. |
| **Gold Workspace** | All Business Users, Reporting Tools | Read-only for most users. |
>
> #### **Capacity Management & Cost Optimization**
> *   **Resource Isolation:** Each layer can have a dedicated Fabric capacity, preventing bronze layer ingestion jobs from impacting gold layer reporting performance.
> *   **Cost Control:** You can assign different capacity sizes or pricing tiers based on the workload (e.g., batch-optimized for Bronze, query-optimized for Gold) and track costs granularly for each layer or business domain.
>
> #### **Governance & Lifecycle Benefits**
> This approach aligns with modern data mesh principles and provides:
> *   **Clear Data Lineage:** Establishes explicit boundaries between processing stages.
> *   **Team Autonomy:** Allows domain-specific teams to own and manage their gold layer workspace independently.
> *   **Independent Deployment:** Enables different teams to manage their development lifecycle without impacting others.
