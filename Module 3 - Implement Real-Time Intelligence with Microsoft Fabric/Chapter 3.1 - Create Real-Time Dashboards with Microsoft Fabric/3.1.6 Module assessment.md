## **Check Your Knowledge: Real-Time Dashboards in Fabric**

Test your understanding of how to create and manage dynamic, streaming visualizations using the Real-Time Intelligence experience in Microsoft Fabric.

#### **1. What is a real-time dashboard?**

<div align="center">
<svg width="100" height="80" viewBox="0 0 100 80" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<rect x="15" y="20" width="70" height="45" rx="4" fill="#E3F2FD" stroke="#1E88E5" stroke-width="2"/>
<path d="M25 50 L 40 40 L 55 55 L 75 35" stroke="#1976D2" stroke-width="2" fill="none"/>
<path d="M55 25 L 45 40 L 55 40 L 50 55" stroke="#FBC02D" stroke-width="2.5" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>

> **Answer: A Real-Time Intelligence item that can display data from a real-time streaming source in Microsoft Fabric.**
>
> **Explanation:** Real-time dashboards are a specific item type within Fabric's **Real-Time Intelligence** workload. Unlike standard Power BI reports, they are purpose-built to connect directly to streaming data sources (like Eventstreams and KQL Databases) and visualize data with sub-second latency. This makes them the ideal tool for operational monitoring, analyzing IoT sensor data, and tracking application logs as events occur.

#### **2. How can you enable users to filter a real-time dashboard interactively?**

<div align="center">
<svg width="100" height="80" viewBox="0 0 100 80" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<rect x="15" y="20" width="70" height="45" rx="4" fill="#E3F2FD" stroke="#1E88E5" stroke-width="2"/>
<path d="M45 10 L 55 10 L 52 15 L 48 15 Z" fill="#BBDEFB" stroke="#1976D2" stroke-width="1.5"/>
<path d="M50 15 V 20" stroke="#1976D2" stroke-width="1.5"/>
<path d="M25 50 L 40 40 L 55 55 L 75 35" stroke="#1976D2" stroke-width="2" fill="none"/>
</svg>
</div>

> **Answer: Add parameters to the dashboard.**
>
> **Explanation:** **Parameters** are the key to creating interactive, self-service dashboards. Instead of hard-coding filters in your underlying KQL queries, you define parameters that appear as user-friendly controls (like dropdowns or text boxes). This empowers end-users to dynamically slice and dice the data to answer their own questions on the fly, without needing any knowledge of the query language.

#### **3. How can you ensure users always see fresh data in a real-time dashboard?**

<div align="center">
<svg width="100" height="80" viewBox="0 0 100 80" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<rect x="15" y="20" width="70" height="45" rx="4" fill="#E3F2FD" stroke="#1E88E5" stroke-width="2"/>
<path d="M75 25 C 75 20, 70 15, 65 15 S 55 20, 55 25" stroke="#1E88E5" stroke-width="2.5" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round"/>
<path d="M55 25 L 50 25 L 55 20" stroke="#1E88E5" stroke-width="2.5" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
</svg>
</div>

> [!tip]
> **Answer: Configure auto refresh for the dashboard.**
>
> **Explanation:** To make a dashboard truly "real-time," you must configure **auto-refresh**. This setting instructs the dashboard to periodically re-run its queries against the data source at specified intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute). This is the mechanism that keeps the visuals constantly updated with the latest streaming data, providing a near-live view of your operations and differentiating it from standard reports that refresh on a schedule of minutes or hours.

### **Key Concepts Recap**

| Concept | Importance in Real-Time Dashboards |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Real-Time Intelligence** | This is Fabric's dedicated, native workload for handling streaming analytics. It provides the high-throughput, low-latency engine required for true real-time scenarios. |
| **Parameters** | These transform a static display into a dynamic, analytical tool. They enable self-service exploration for users without requiring them to modify the underlying code. |
| **Auto-Refresh** | This is the critical feature that ensures data freshness. Without it, a dashboard is just a snapshot in time. With it, it becomes a live window into your data streams. |
