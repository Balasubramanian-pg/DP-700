In this module, you learned about real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric. Together with other Real-Time Intelligence capabilities in Microsoft Fabric, real-time dashboards enable you to provide users with data visualizations that can help them gain insights and make time-sensitive decisions based on events as they happen.


A dashboard is a collection of tiles, optionally organized in pages, where each tile has an underlying query and a visual representation. You can natively export Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to a dashboard as visuals and later modify their underlying queries and visual formatting as needed. In addition to ease of data exploration, this fully integrated dashboard experience provides improved query and visualization performance.

In this article, you learn how to create a new Real-Time Dashboard, add data sources, and add tiles to the dashboard. You also learn how to enable auto refresh, use parameters, and export dashboards.

## Use parameters

Parameters significantly improve dashboard rendering performance, and enable you to use filter values as early as possible in the query. Filtering is enabled when the parameter is included in the query associated with your tiles. For more information about how to set up and use different kinds of parameters, see [Use parameters in Real-Time Dashboards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-parameters).[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create#tile-legend)

## Tile legend

You can change the position of the legend in your tiles and use the legend to interact with the data.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create#change-the-legend-location)

### Change the legend location

If you have edit rights on a real-time dashboard, you can change the location of the legend in your tile. Toggle to **Edit** mode and select the **Edit** pencil icon. In the **Visual formatting** pane, under **Legend**, you can select your location preference.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create#interact-with-your-data)

### Interact with your data

You can use the legend to interact with the data in your tile. You can change what data you view by selecting the specific item in the legend. Use Ctrl to add or remove items from the selection, hold shift to select a range. Items not selected are greyed out.

The **Search** button allows you to search and filter items.
Use the **Invert** button to invert your selection.
The **Up** and **Down** arrows navigate through the list in the following ways:

- When one item is selected, the up and down arrows select the previous or next item.
- When more than one item is selected, the up and down arrows scroll through the list of items, and the data for any selected items you navigate to is highlighted.

![Screenshot showing the buttons to use the legend to interact with your data.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/interactive-legend.png)

[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create#view-query)

## View query

You can view the query in either editing or viewing mode. Editing the underlying query of a tile is only possible in editing mode.

1. On the tile you want to explore, select the **More menu [...]** > **View query**. A pane opens with the query and results table.
    
    [![Screenshot of the View query menu for a tile on the dashboard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/view-query-menu.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/view-query-menu.png#lightbox)
    
2. Select **Edit query**.
    
3. Choose either **Existing KQL Queryset** or **New KQL Queryset**. Proceed to edit the query in the [KQL Queryset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/kusto-query-set).
    
    [![Screenshot of the KQL query editor.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/edit-query.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/edit-query.png#lightbox

> [!NOTE]
>     Any edits made to the query using this flow won't be reflected in the original Real-Time Dashboard.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create#enable-auto-refresh)

## Enable auto refresh

Auto refresh is a feature that allows you to automatically update the data on a dashboard without manually reloading the page or clicking a refresh button.

Dashboard authors can configure autorefresh settings for other viewers. By default, the refresh rate is set using the **Default refresh rate**, but viewers can adjust this rate for their own sessions.

The **Minimum time interval** defines the fastest refresh rate allowed and acts as a lower limit. For example, if the author sets the default refresh rate to 1 hour and the minimum time interval to 30 minutes, viewers can choose a refresh rate between 30 minutes and 1 hour, but not lower than 30 minutes.

This setting gives authors control over how frequently dashboards can refresh, helping to manage system load and performance.

1. Select the **Manage** tab > **Auto refresh**.
2. Toggle the option so auto refresh is **Enabled**.
3. Select values for **Minimum time interval** and **Default refresh rate**.
4. Select **Apply** and then **Save** the dashboard.

1. Select **Share** in the top-right corner of the dashboard.
    
    [![Screenshot that shows the Share button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/share-link.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/share-link.png#lightbox)
    
2. In the **Create and send link** window, you can do the following steps:
    
    - To see a link to the dashboard and copy it to the clipboard, select **Copy link**.
    - To share a link to the dashboard via email, select **by Email**.
    - To share a link to the dashboard via Teams, select **by Teams**.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create#export-dashboards)

## Export dashboards

Use the file menu to export a dashboard to a JSON file. Exporting dashboard can be useful in the following scenarios:

- **Version control**: You can use the file to restore the dashboard to a previous version.
- **Dashboard template**: You can use the file as template for creating new dashboards.
- **Manual editing**: You can edit the file to modify the dashboard. The file can be imported back to the dashboard.

To export a dashboard, in the dashboard, select the **Manage** tab > **|-> Download file**. [![Screenshot that shows the Download file button on the Manage tab button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/download-file-button.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/media/real-time-dashboard/download-file-button.png#lightbox)
