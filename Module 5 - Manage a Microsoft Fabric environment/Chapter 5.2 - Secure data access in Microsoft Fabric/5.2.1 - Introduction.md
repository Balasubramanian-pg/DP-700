# Securing Your Data Estate in Microsoft Fabric: A Use-Case Driven Approach

Security in Microsoft Fabric is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's a sophisticated, multi-layered system designed to be optimized for specific **use cases**, empowering every user with precisely the access they need to perform their job, and nothing more.

Different users—from data engineers to report consumers—require different permissions to interact with data, compute resources, and Fabric items. Fabric's security model is built to facilitate this, allowing you to grant access to specific data workloads through a combination of workspace permissions, item-level sharing, and granular data access roles.

### Why This Matters: A Real-World Healthcare Scenario

To understand the importance of use-case driven security, imagine you work at a healthcare company. Your data estate is vast and sensitive, containing electronic health records (EHR), insurance claims, clinical trial data, and patient registries.

Different people need to access this data in fundamentally different ways:
-   **Data engineers** need broad access to raw data in a lakehouse to build and maintain data products.
-   **Data scientists** need to consume large datasets via Apache Spark to train predictive models.
-   **Business analysts** need to query curated data to answer specific business questions.
-   **Doctors and clinicians (report consumers)** only need to view aggregated, anonymized data in a Power BI report to make patient care decisions.

A single security policy would either be too restrictive, blocking critical work, or too permissive, creating massive security risks. Fabric's model is designed to solve this exact problem.

### In This Module: Your Path to Mastering Fabric Security

This module will teach you how to leverage Fabric's access control features to provide your team with the right access to the right data at the right time. You will explore Fabric's multi-layer security model and learn how to apply it to manage data access effectively and securely.

By the end of this module, you will be able to confidently configure security at every level:

| You Will Learn How To... | Icon | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Configure Workspace Security** | <div align="center"><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M10 4H4C2.89 4 2 4.89 2 6V18C2 19.11 2.89 20 4 20H20C21.11 20 22 19.11 22 18V12H20V18H4V6H10V4M14 4V6H20V8H14V10L11 7L14 4Z" fill="#7B1FA2"/></svg></div> | Manage broad access for collaborative teams using the Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer roles. This is your first and widest layer of security. |

| **Apply Granular Permissions** | <div align="center"><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M3 4H21V6H3V4M3 14H21V16H3V14M9.5 9C9.5 10.11 8.61 11 7.5 11C6.39 11 5.5 10.11 5.5 9C5.5 7.89 6.39 7 7.5 7C8.61 7 9.5 7.89 9.5 9M3 19H21V21H3V19Z" fill="#7B1FA2"/></svg></div> | Implement the most detailed level of security within a data item, such as **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and **Column-Level Security (CLS)** in a warehouse, or **OneLake data access roles** for the lakehouse. |

By the end of this module, you'll be equipped to design and implement a security model that is both robust and flexible, perfectly tailored to the unique needs of your organization.
