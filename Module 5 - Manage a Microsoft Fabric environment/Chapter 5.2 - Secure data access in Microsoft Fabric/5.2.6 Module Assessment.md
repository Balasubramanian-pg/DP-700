## 1. What is the order of evaluation of access in Fabric?

**Correct Answer: Microsoft Entra ID authentication, Fabric access, Data security**

*   **Explanation:** Access in Fabric is evaluated in a logical, layered sequence:
    1.  **Microsoft Entra ID Authentication:** This is the first and most fundamental gate. A user must first prove their identity by signing in and authenticating with their Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) credentials. If this fails, access is denied immediately.
    2.  **Fabric Access (Authorization):** Once authenticated, the system checks what general permissions the user has within the Fabric platform. This is primarily governed by their **role in the workspace** (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer). This determines if they can see the workspace, create items, or just view content.
    3.  **Data Security:** Finally, if a user has Fabric-level access to an item (like a Lakehouse), the specific data permissions are evaluated. This includes **SQL GRANT/DENY statements**, **Row-Level Security (RLS)**, and **Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)** defined within the data item itself. A user with Admin access to a workspace might still be restricted from viewing certain rows or columns based on these granular, data-level rules.

## 2. What workspace role should be assigned to a data engineer who needs to create Fabric items and read all data in an existing lakehouse?

**Correct Answer: Contributor**

*   **Explanation:** Let's break down the requirements against the workspace roles:
    *   **"Create Fabric items"**: This requires permissions to create, edit, and delete items within a workspace. The **Viewer** role is read-only and cannot do this. Both **Contributor** and **Admin** can create items.
    *   **"Read all data in an existing lakehouse"**: All three roles (Viewer, Contributor, Admin) can *view and query* data in Lakehouses and other items within a workspace they have access to.
    *   **The Key Differentiator:** The **Admin** role has additional administrative permissions (managing workspace access for others, updating settings) that are not required for this persona. Therefore, the **Contributor** role is the most appropriate and follows the principle of least privilege, granting the necessary permissions without providing extra, unneeded administrative power.

## 3. Which of the following tools can be used to apply granular data access permissions in Fabric?

**Correct Answer: Column-level security in the semantic model**

*   **Explanation:** The question asks for *granular data access permissions*, which means controlling access at the column or row level *within* a dataset.
    *   **Column-level security (CLS) in the semantic model:** This is a correct and powerful method. Within a Power BI semantic model (dataset), you can define roles that restrict which users can see specific columns. This is the definition of granular data access control.
    *   **OneLake data access roles:** This is a distractor. OneLake itself uses a unified file-system API and does not have a concept of "data access roles." Access to data in OneLake is controlled via the Fabric workspace roles and the underlying engine-specific security (like the SQL permissions in a Lakehouse's SQL Endpoint).
    *   **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** DML (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) is a language for manipulating data, not for controlling access permissions. The correct SQL category for permissions is **Data Control Language (DCL)**, which includes commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.

### Summary

| Question | Correct Answer | Key Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Order of Evaluation | **Microsoft Entra ID authentication, Fabric access, Data security** | Access is a layered process: authenticate first, then authorize platform access, then apply data-specific rules. |
| 2. Workspace Role for Data Engineer | **Contributor** | The Contributor role provides the ability to create items (like pipelines, notebooks) and read data, without granting full Admin privileges. |
| 3. Tool for Granular Permissions | **Column-level security in the semantic model** | Granular permissions control access *within* a dataset, which is achieved in the semantic model or via SQL security objects (RLS, DDM) in the data warehouse. |
