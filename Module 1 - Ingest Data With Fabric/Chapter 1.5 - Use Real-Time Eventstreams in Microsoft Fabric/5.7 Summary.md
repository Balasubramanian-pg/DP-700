In this module, you've explored the use of Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric to ingest and transform real-time streams of data. You also had the opportunity to build an eventstream of your own.

# Fabric Eventstream - overview
The eventstreams feature in the Microsoft Fabric **Real-Time Intelligence** experience lets you bring real-time events into Fabric, transform them, and then route them to various destinations without writing any code (no-code). You create an eventstream, which is an instance of the **Eventstream** item in Fabric, add event data sources to the stream, optionally add transformations to transform the event data, and then route the data to supported destinations. Additionally, with Apache Kafka endpoints available on the Eventstream item, you can send or consume real-time events using the Kafka protocol.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities#bring-events-into-fabric)

## Bring events into Fabric

The eventstreams feature provides you with various source connectors to fetch event data from the various sources. There are more sources available when you enable **Enhanced capabilities** at the time of creating an eventstream.

[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities#process-events-using-no-code-experience)

## Process events using no-code experience

The drag and drop experience gives you an intuitive and easy way to create your event data processing, transforming, and routing logic without writing any code. An end-to-end data flow diagram in an eventstream can provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the data flow and organization. The event processor editor is a no-code experience that allows you to drag and drop to design the event data processing logic.

|Transformation|Description|
|---|---|
|Filter|Use the Filter transformation to filter events based on the value of a field in the input. Depending on the data type (number or text), the transformation keeps the values that match the selected condition, such as `is null` or `is not null`.|
|Manage fields|The Manage fields transformation allows you to add, remove, change data type, or rename fields coming in from an input or another transformation.|
|Aggregate|Use the Aggregate transformation to calculate an aggregation (Sum, Minimum, Maximum, or Average) every time a new event occurs over a period of time. This operation also allows for the renaming of these calculated columns, and filtering or slicing the aggregation based on other dimensions in your data. You can have one or more aggregations in the same transformation.|
|Group by|Use the Group by transformation to calculate aggregations across all events within a certain time window. You can group by the values in one or more fields. It's like the Aggregate transformation allows for the renaming of columns, but provides more options for aggregation and includes more complex options for time windows. Like Aggregate, you can add more than one aggregation per transformation.|
|Union|Use the Union transformation to connect two or more nodes and add events with shared fields (with the same name and data type) into one table. Fields that don't match are dropped and not included in the output.|
|Expand|Use the Expand array transformation to create a new row for each value within an array.|
|Join|Use the Join transformation to combine data from two streams based on a matching condition between them.|

If you enabled **Enhanced capabilities** while creating an eventstream, the transformation operations are supported for all destinations (with derived stream acting as an intermediate bridge for some destinations, like Custom endpoint, Fabric Activator). If you didn't, the transformation operations are available only for the Lakehouse and Eventhouse (event processing before ingestion) destinations.

[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities#route-events-to-destinations)

## Route events to destinations

The Fabric event streams feature supports sending data to the following supported destinations.

- [Enhanced capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities#tabpanel_2_enhancedcapabilities)
- [Standard capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities#tabpanel_2_standardcapabilities)

|Destination|Description|
|---|---|
|[Custom endpoint (i.e., Custom App in standard capability)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-destination-custom-app)|With this destination, you can easily route your real-time events to a custom endpoint. You can connect your own applications to the eventstream and consume the event data in real time. This destination is useful when you want to egress real-time data to an external system outside Microsoft Fabric.|
|[Eventhouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-destination-kql-database)|This destination lets you ingest your real-time event data into an Eventhouse, where you can use the powerful Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query and analyze the data. With the data in the Eventhouse, you can gain deeper insights into your event data and create rich reports and dashboards. You can choose between two ingestion modes: **Direct ingestion** and **Event processing before ingestion**.|
|[Lakehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-destination-lakehouse)|This destination gives you the ability to transform your real-time events before ingesting them into your lakehouse. Real-time events convert into Delta Lake format and then store in the designated lakehouse tables. This destination supports data warehousing scenarios.|
|[Derived stream](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-destination-derived-stream)|Derived stream is a specialized type of destination that you can create after adding stream operations, such as Filter or Manage Fields, to an eventstream. The derived stream represents the transformed default stream following stream processing. You can route the derived stream to multiple destinations in Fabric, and view the derived stream in the Real-Time hub.|
|[Fabric Activator (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-destination-activator)|This destination lets you directly connect your real-time event data to a Fabric Activator. Activator is a type of intelligent agent that contains all the information necessary to connect to data, monitor for conditions, and act. When the data reaches certain thresholds or matches other patterns, Activator automatically takes appropriate action such as alerting users or kicking off Power Automate workflows.|

You can attach multiple destinations in an eventstream to simultaneously receive data from your eventstreams without interfering with each other.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use the Microsoft Fabric event streams feature with at least four capacity units ([SKU](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/licenses#capacity): F4)

[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities#apache-kafka-on-fabric-event-streams)

## Apache Kafka on Fabric event streams

The Fabric event streams feature offers an Apache Kafka endpoint on the Eventstream item, enabling users to connect and consume streaming events through the Kafka protocol. If your application already uses the Apache Kafka protocol to send or receive streaming events with specific topics, you can easily connect it to your Eventstream. Just update your connection settings to use the Kafka endpoint provided in your Eventstream.

Fabric event streams feature is powered by Azure Event Hubs, a fully managed cloud-native service. When an eventstream is created, an event hub namespace is automatically provisioned, and an event hub is allocated to the default stream without requiring any provisioning configurations. To learn more about the Kafka-compatible features in Azure Event Hubs service, see [Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/azure-event-hubs-kafka-overview).

To learn more about how to obtain the Kafka endpoint details for sending events to eventstream, see [Add custom endpoint source to an eventstream](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-source-custom-app); and for consuming events from eventstream, see [Add a custom endpoint destination to an eventstream](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-destination-custom-app).
