Here are the correct answers to your knowledge check questions:  

### **1. What is the primary function of Microsoft Fabric Eventstreams?**  
✅ **Ingesting and transforming real-time data.**  
- Eventstreams is designed to handle real-time data streams, allowing you to ingest, process, and route events as they occur.  
- It is not primarily for batch loading (that’s more for Data Warehouse or Lakehouse) or running Spark jobs (that’s handled by Spark compute).

### **2. What do temporal window transformations enable you to do?**  
✅ **Aggregate event data in a stream based on specific time periods.**  
- Windowing functions (like tumbling, sliding, session, etc.) help analyze streaming data by grouping events into time-based segments for aggregation (e.g., counts, averages).  
- They do not schedule streaming enable/disable or delete expired data (retention policies handle that separately).

### **3. What is the purpose of the Fabric Activator destination in an eventstream?**  
✅ **Data sent to an Activator destination can be used to trigger an automated action based on data values.**  
- The **Activator** allows you to set up real-time triggers (e.g., alerts, workflows) when certain conditions are met in the streaming data.  
- It does not control data visibility in a Lakehouse/Eventhouse or reset transformations.
