Based on my knowledge of Microsoft Fabric, Spark, and PySpark, here are the answers:

**1. Which SQL magic command should you use in a Microsoft Fabric notebook to execute SQL queries directly?** **Answer: %%sql**

The `%%sql` magic command allows you to write and execute SQL queries directly in notebook cells, switching the cell from the default language to SQL.

**2. Which practice should be followed to optimize data processing performance in a Spark pool using the native execution engine in Microsoft Fabric?** 
**Answer: Enable the native execution engine at the environment level by setting relevant Spark properties.
The native execution engine provides vectorized operations and performance optimizations. It should be enabled through Spark configuration properties at the environment level.

**3. What is the expected result of executing the following PySpark command: df.groupBy('Category').agg({'SalesAmount': 'sum'})?** 
**Answer: A new dataframe with each category and the sum of sales amounts for each category. 
This command groups the dataframe by Category and aggregates SalesAmount using sum, returning a new dataframe with categories and their total sales.

**4. When working with large datasets, which Spark Dataframe method is preferred for performance when only a subset of columns is needed?** **Answer: select
The `select` method allows you to choose only the columns you need, reducing data transfer and memory usage, which is crucial for performance with large datasets.

> **5. When creating a custom environment in Microsoft Fabric, which setting allows you to use a specific version of Apache Spark for your tasks?** **Answer: Specify the Spark runtime in the environment settings.**
> Custom environments allow you to specify the Spark runtime version along with other configurations like libraries and dependencies.

**6. A data engineer is tasked with optimizing the performance of Spark SQL queries run in Microsoft Fabric. Which configuration setting can directly impact query performance?** 

> [!NOTE]
> Answer: Enabling the native execution engine for vectorized operations.
> The native execution engine provides significant performance improvements through vectorized operations and optimized query execution.

**7. You need to calculate the average sales amount for each product category in a Spark dataframe. Which code snippet accurately achieves this task?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: avg_sales_df = df.groupBy('Category').agg({'SalesAmount': 'avg'})**
> This correctly groups by Category first, then aggregates SalesAmount using the average function.
> Looking at the three options for calculating the average sales amount for each product category:

> [!Tip]
> **The correct answer is: `avg_sales_df = df.groupBy('Category').agg({'SalesAmount': 'avg'})`**
> 
> Here's why:
> 
> 1. **First option: `df.agg({'SalesAmount': 'mean'}).groupBy('Category')`** - This is **incorrect** because:
>     
>     - The order is wrong - you can't call `groupBy()` after `agg()`
>     - `agg()` without `groupBy()` first would calculate the overall mean across all rows, not per category
>     - This would cause a syntax error
> 2. **Second option: `df.groupBy('Category').agg({'SalesAmount': 'avg'})`** - This is **correct** because:
>     
>     - First groups the data by 'Category'
>     - Then aggregates within each group using the average function on 'SalesAmount'
>     - This gives you the average sales amount for each category
> 3. **Third option: `df.select('Category', 'avg(SalesAmount)')`** - This is **incorrect** because:
>     
>     - `select()` alone doesn't perform grouping
>     - This would try to select individual Category values alongside an aggregated average, which would cause an error
>     - You need `groupBy()` before you can use aggregate functions like `avg()`
> 
> The correct pattern in Spark is always: **group first, then aggregate**.

**8. Your data engineering team needs to perform complex calculations on a large dataset using PySpark. They want to ensure the fastest possible execution. What Spark pool configuration should they use in Microsoft Fabric?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Enable the native execution engine and use memory optimized nodes.**
> For complex calculations on large datasets, the native execution engine provides performance benefits, and memory optimized nodes ensure sufficient memory for processing.

**9. Your organization needs to analyze customer data stored in a lakehouse and visualize demographic distributions using Spark in Microsoft Fabric. Which Spark feature would facilitate this analysis?** 

> [!NOTE]
> Answer: Dataframe API for structured data manipulation and Spark SQL for querying.
> The DataFrame API and Spark SQL are ideal for structured data analysis, providing powerful querying and manipulation capabilities needed for demographic analysis.
