### 1. What is an eventhouse?
✅ **A data store for real-time data in KQL databases.**

Key characteristics:
- Optimized for high-velocity streaming data
- Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) for queries
- Part of Microsoft Fabric's real-time analytics capabilities
- Not to be confused with a lakehouse (which is for batch processing)

### 2. What is the purpose of using the project operator in KQL?
✅ **To specify which columns to include in your query output.**

Important notes about `project`:
- Similar to SQL's SELECT but with pipeline syntax
- Reduces data volume by selecting only needed columns
- Can rename columns: `| project new_name = original_name`
- Often used after filtering (`where`) for optimal performance

### 3. How can you create a reusable parameterized query for a KQL database?
✅ **Create a stored function.**

Why stored functions are ideal:
- Encapsulate complex query logic
- Support parameters for customization
- Can be called like tables: `my_function(param=value)`
- Example:
  ```kql
  .create-or-alter function filtered_trips(min_fare:real)
  {
      Automotive
      | where fare_amount > min_fare
  }
  ```

### Additional Clarifications:

**Materialized Views** (the other option) are different because:
- They store pre-aggregated results, not parameterized logic
- Automatically update as new data arrives
- Optimized for specific summarization patterns

**Eventhouse vs. Other Options**:
- Not just for tracking load events (that's more like a logging table)
- Not synonymous with lakehouse (lakehouse handles batch data in Delta format)

**Project vs Other Operators**:
- `summarize` handles aggregations (count/sum/avg)
- `where` handles filtering
- `project` is purely for column selection

These concepts are fundamental for working effectively with real-time data in Microsoft Fabric's Eventhouse environment.
