Real-time dashboards provide a way to pin data visualizations to a single visual interface, enabling you to surface real-time insights at a glance. Each _tile_ in a dashboard shows you different information based on a KQL query that extracts real-time data from tables in an eventhouse.

## Creating a real-time dashboard

You can create a real-time dashboard in a workspace and then configure its source, or you can create one directly from a KQL queryset in an eventhouse.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a real-time dashboard, an administrator for your Fabric tenant must have enabled the feature at the tenant level

Dashboards are composed of one or more _tiles_, each containing a visualization based on a KQL query expression. By default, the visualization shows the results of the query as a table; but you can edit the tile to customize how the data is displayed.

When published, tiles enable users to explore the data they contain interactively by drilling into the data and using a visual interface to filter and aggregate the data, and change the visualization type.

## Visualizing real-time data with Power BI

Since Power BI is a core component of the Fabric platform, you can also visualize data in a KQL database as a Power BI report.

# Complete Guide to Real-Time Dashboards in Microsoft Fabric

## Overview

Real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric provide a powerful way to monitor, analyze, and visualize streaming data as it flows through your organization. These dashboards serve as centralized command centers where stakeholders can gain immediate insights from live data sources without the delays associated with traditional batch processing.

## What Are Real-Time Dashboards?

Real-time dashboards are interactive visual interfaces that display live data through a collection of tiles, each powered by Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries.

## KQL Query Optimization for Dashboards

### Performance Considerations

Real-time dashboards require optimized queries for responsive performance:

#### Query Structure

```kql
// Efficient time-based filtering
EventTable
| where Timestamp >= ago(1h)
| summarize Count = count(), AvgValue = avg(MetricValue) by bin(Timestamp, 5m)
| order by Timestamp desc
```

#### Best Practices

- **Time Range Filtering**: Always include relevant time filters
- **Aggregation First**: Summarize data before complex operations
- **Index Utilization**: Leverage eventhouse indexing strategies
- **Limit Result Sets**: Use `take` or `top` operators appropriately
- **Cached Results**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Common Query Patterns

#### Real-Time Metrics

```kql
// Live transaction monitoring
TransactionLogs
| where Timestamp >= ago(5m)
| summarize 
    TotalTransactions = count(),
    SuccessRate = countif(Status == "Success") * 100.0 / count(),
    AvgResponseTime = avg(ResponseTimeMs)
| project TotalTransactions, SuccessRate, AvgResponseTime
```

#### Trend Analysis

```kql
// Hourly trend comparison
MetricsData
| where Timestamp >= ago(24h)
| summarize Value = avg(MetricValue) by bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| extend PreviousValue = prev(Value, 1)
| extend TrendDirection = case(
    Value > PreviousValue, "Up",
    Value < PreviousValue, "Down",
    "Stable"
)
```
