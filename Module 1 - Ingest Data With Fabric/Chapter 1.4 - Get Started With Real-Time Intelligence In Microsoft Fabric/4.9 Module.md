**1. What transformation can you apply in an eventstream to create a new row for each value within an array?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Expand**
> The Expand transformation is specifically designed to flatten array structures by creating a new row for each element within an array field. This is essential when working with nested or array data that needs to be processed at the individual element level.

**2. In terms of functionality, how do Activator alerts differ from simple notifications?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Activator alerts automate responses to specific data conditions.**
> 
> Activator alerts in Microsoft Fabric are intelligent automation tools that can trigger automated actions (like sending emails, calling APIs, or updating systems) when specific data conditions are met, rather than just providing passive notifications.

**3. Which component in Microsoft Fabric is used to capture, transform, and ingest real-time data from a variety of streaming sources?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Eventstream**
> 
> Eventstream is the dedicated component for real-time data ingestion and transformation in Microsoft Fabric. It handles the capture, processing, and routing of streaming data from various sources.

**4. What type of transformation should be applied if you need to calculate the maximum temperature recorded by a sensor every minute?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Aggregate transformation**
> 
> Aggregate transformation is used for calculating summary statistics (like max, min, average, count) over time windows or groupings. Computing the maximum temperature per minute is a classic aggregation operation.

**5. Your organization wants to perform sentiment analysis on social media data in real-time to adjust marketing strategies dynamically. Which Microsoft Fabric component should be used to store and query this real-time data efficiently?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: KQL database within an eventhouse**
> 
> KQL databases within eventhouses are optimized for real-time analytics and time-series data. They provide the high-performance querying capabilities needed for real-time sentiment analysis and can handle the velocity and volume of social media data streams.

**6. What role does a KQL database play in enhancing the functionality of real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: It provides live data queries that populate dashboard tiles.**
> 
> KQL databases serve as the query engine for real-time dashboards, executing KQL queries that extract and transform data to populate dashboard tiles with live, up-to-date information.

**7. During the transformation of data in an eventstream, you notice that some fields are not being included in the output. Which transformation step could be responsible for this issue?

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Filter transformation**
> 
> Filter transformations can exclude records or fields based on specified conditions. If fields are missing from the output, it's likely due to filter conditions that are removing them from the data stream.

**8. How is the use of Activator alerts in Microsoft Fabric different from using manual monitoring techniques?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: Activator alerts automate responses to predefined conditions without manual intervention.**
> 
> This is the key differentiator - Activator provides automated, condition-based responses that operate continuously without requiring human oversight, unlike manual monitoring which requires constant attention and manual response actions.

**9. When setting up an eventstream in Microsoft Fabric to capture real-time data, which data source would NOT be supported for ingestion?** 

> [!NOTE]
> **Answer: On-premises SQL Server database without any cloud integration**
> 
> Eventstreams are designed for streaming data sources. An on-premises SQL Server database without cloud integration doesn't provide the streaming interfaces (like change data capture streams or event-driven updates) that eventstreams require. Traditional databases need additional components or integration services to provide streaming capabilities.

These answers reflect the core capabilities and architecture of Microsoft Fabric's real-time intelligence components, focusing on their streaming, transformation, and automation capabilities.
